# TelcoChurn

Purpose: My own person purpose of this project is continue to employ data anlaysis skills in Python while continue to practice using various classifications. For this data set, the main objective is to figure out if we can find the major feature variables that can help explain for the churn over for this company.

Data Analysis: Explore the data by plotting categorical data and visualizing the distribution of a dataset through various visualization techniques while developing questions about the data. In addition, cleaning the dataset to getting prepared for the modeling phase

Modeling: Explores various classification tools like logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, and svm. Feature importance (and relative Feature Importance), ROC Curves, and a neat Confusion Matrix function.

I have done moderate level of analysis of the data and proceeded with modeling; however, it is still in need of organization

As of 17 December 2018,

YAY! I made a lot of strives with this project in that I managed to do modeling where I got the featured variables, confusion matrix for all models in one functions, and table with all the methods of evaluting all models. Additionally, I played with violin! Please enjoy! :)


Future Work: I still want to play with Data Analysis more! So, I may make a notebook exploring one central question aside from the who churns and who doesnt.
