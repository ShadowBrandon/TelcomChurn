# TelcomChurn

Purpose: The purpose of this project is continue to employ data anlaysis while going through motions of classification techniques. The main objective is to figure out if we can find the major feature variables that can help explain for the churn over for this company

Data Analysis: Cleans and explores the data along with developing questions about the data

Modeling: Explores logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, and svm. If possible, we try to look feature importance.

I have done moderate level of analysis of the data and proceeded with modeling; however, it is still in need of organization

As of 17 December 2018,

YAY! I made a lot of strives with this project in that I managed to do modeling where I got the featured variables, confusion matrix for all models in one functions, and table with all the methods of evaluting all models. Additionally, I played with violin! Please enjoy! :)


Future Work: I still want to play with Data Analysis more! So, I may make a notebook exploring one central question aside from the who churns and who doesnt.
